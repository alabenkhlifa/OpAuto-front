## Stability Session 2026-04-20 (full-suite audit)

Comprehensive end-to-end testing of every screen + backend endpoint. 12 commits landed. Full transcript in `TEST_RESULTS.md`, bug breakdown in `docs/BUGS.md` (BUG-019 … BUG-040).

### P0 — blockers fixed
- [x] UI create-appointment → 400 (frontend sent `status:SCHEDULED` that DTO rejected)
- [x] Invoice Create page rendering raw `invoicing.create.*` i18n keys
- [x] Invoice Create page using 3 hardcoded mock customers instead of real 15
- [x] Module guard silent redirect → now shows toast "This module needs activation"
- [x] Dashboard "Generate Invoice" → 404 (`/invoicing` → `/invoices/create`)
- [x] Customers page showing 0 counts (loadStats race with loadCustomers)
- [x] Invoicing dashboard KPIs showing 0 (same race pattern)
- [x] Inventory dashboard showing 0 (same race pattern)

### P1 — data / workflow fixes
- [x] Invoice `paidAt` stays null after PAID → now set in `addPayment`
- [x] Employee roles all "Senior Mechanic" → expanded role type (Mechanic / Electrician / Bodywork Specialist / Tire Specialist)
- [x] `TIRE_ALIGNMENT` department missing translation
- [x] `common.reset` raw key on Settings
- [x] Maintenance cards showing "undefined Ford Focus" + empty CUSTOMER/Mileage → backend now includes `car.year`, `car.mileage`, `car.customer`
- [x] Cars cards always showing "Total Services: 0 / N/A" → backend aggregates from COMPLETED appointments
- [x] Cars Make filter empty → rebuilds from loaded cars via signal-backed computed
- [x] GET `/api/inventory/suppliers` 404 → returns `[]`
- [x] Maintenance "Complete Job" → 400 (`completionDate` not in DTO)
- [x] Maintenance "New Job" form raw `maintenance.new.*` keys → added en/fr/ar
- [x] Invoice detail direct-nav showed epoch dates + empty fields → `fetchInvoiceById` HTTP fallback
- [x] Invoice detail garage footer hardcoded ("OpAuto Garage / contact@opautogatage.tn" typo) → loads from `/garage-settings`
- [x] Invoice schema now has optional `carId` relation (Car.invoices reverse); detail shows "Volkswagen Golf 8 (2022) / 234TUN567"
- [x] Employee "Mark Unavailable" silently no-op'd → added `isAvailable`+`unavailableReason`+`unavailableUntil` to schema
- [x] Inactive employees showed "Available" on their cards → status AND isAvailable
- [x] Notifications Delete silently no-op'd → added `DELETE /notifications/:id` backend route
- [x] Login bad creds silent → now shows "Invalid username/email or password"
- [x] Change Password was a stub → implemented backend `POST /auth/change-password` + wired frontend
- [x] Reports Export button was `console.log` → generates CSV download with 6 KPIs
- [x] Staff got 403 on `GET /employees` (blocked appointment mechanic dropdown) → moved `@Roles(OWNER)` to mutations only
- [x] Staff got 403 on dashboard `GET /invoices` + sidebar `GET /approvals` → gated by `isOwner()` in caller
- [x] Owner-only route redirect was silent → `ownerGuard` now shows warning toast (en/fr/ar); bootstrap race fixed with `filter(user!==null), take(1)`

### P2 — polish
- [x] Currency format unified across 9 helpers (all `fr-TN` with `minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 2`) — was mix of 0/2/3 decimals
- [x] Pluralization: `TranslationService.instant()` now understands `{one, other}` objects
- [x] Dashboard Today's Schedule: "1 appointment scheduled" / "5 appointments"
- [x] Customers: "1 car" / "2 cars" (was "1 cars")
- [x] Invoicing Pending: "1 invoice" / "3 invoices" (was "1 invoice(s)")
- [x] Dashboard "brake-repair •" raw slug → shows real car make/model
- [x] Duplicate top-level `invoicing` key in en/fr/ar.json → merged, removed dead block
- [x] Onboarding tour now honors per-user dismissal (`shouldShowTour()` check added to `startTourForCurrentUser`)
- [x] Maintenance KPI "Pending Approvals" (confusing with separate `/approvals` page) → renamed "Jobs Needing Approval"
- [x] Added i18n keys: `common.reset`, `employees.departments.tire-alignment`, `invoicing.create.*`, `invoicing.pending.*`, `maintenance.new.*`, `modules.activationRequired`, `modules.names.*`, `reports.export.{downloaded,tierRequired}`, `auth.ownerOnly`, `customers.labels.carsCount`

### Coverage
- Backend: 50+ endpoints across auth/customers/cars/employees/appointments/invoices/maintenance/inventory/modules/approvals/notifications/garage-settings/ai/users/reports — all GET/POST/PUT/DELETE verified via curl
- Frontend: every sidebar page loaded + every top-level button clicked. Staff role audit (`mohamed/staff123`) confirms sidebar filters, owner-only guards work, staff can complete their core flow (appointments + maintenance).
- Mobile responsive (375×667): sidebar slide-in/out works, no horizontal overflow on Dashboard/Appointments/Cars/Customers/Reports/Modules.
- Arabic text renders correctly but RTL layout is intentionally disabled (`LanguageService.updateDocumentDirection` hardcodes `dir=ltr`).

### Maintenance UI deep-dive (2026-04-20 later)
- [x] New Job form submit (was 400: stripped `customerId/status/tasks/approvals/mileage` from payload)
- [x] Mechanic dropdown populated from real employees (was 3 hardcoded mock IDs)
- [x] Edit Job submit (same 400 cleanup)
- [x] Start Job → in-progress transition
- [x] Complete Job → completed, appears in History tab
- [x] PENDING ↔ waiting enum mapping in both directions
- [x] Backend create/update now return relations (car, customer, mechanic)
- [x] **Tasks persist** — added POST/PUT/DELETE `/maintenance/:jobId/tasks/:taskId?` (commit `648b7b4`). Form's `syncTasks()` runs after job save, diffs original vs current task IDs and fires the right endpoint per task.

## Stability Session 2026-04-21 (resume — 10 tickets verified, 15 bugs fixed, 14 tests added)

BUG-063, 065, 066, 067, 068, 069, 071, 073, 074 exercised end-to-end. BUG-089/090/091 found + fixed along the way. See `docs/BUGS.md` for per-ticket detail.

### Invoice Draft → Sent → Paid (BUG-068)
- [x] Verified UI transitions (status + sidebar badge + list card progress) end-to-end
- [x] **`/invoices` list endpoint now includes `payments[]`** (was omitted → cards showed paid=0 / 0% for all PAID invoices)
- [x] **`invoicing.list.*` i18n namespace added** (en/fr/ar × 24 keys — list card was rendering raw keys)
- [x] **Seeder creates Payment rows for PAID invoices** (seed data had status=PAID with no Payment rows → UI stats misreported)
- [x] Tests: 7 unit + 7 integration (invoicing.service.spec, invoicing.e2e-spec, seed-payments.e2e-spec)

### Settings save (BUG-073)
- [x] Garage Info save verified end-to-end (name, phone, email, address persist across reload)
- [x] Relaxed over-strict Required validators on `registrationNumber`/`taxId`/`city`/`postalCode`/`country` (backend schema has no columns for these — form was permanently invalid)
- [x] Working Hours seed shape fixed (`mon/tue/...` → `monday/tuesday/...` with `isWorkingDay/openTime/closeTime`) — checkboxes now populate correctly
- [ ] Operations capacity/service/appointment, System, Integrations sub-forms still silent no-ops (BUG-087a/b/c — backend `Garage` schema + `mapToBackend` don't cover those fields)

### Add modals (BUG-074)
- [x] Add Customer submit + persist verified (`/customers/new` full page; creates record + navigates to detail)
- [x] Add Car (aka Register New Car) — fixed by Add Customer working + existing flow
- [x] Add Part — **`/inventory/suppliers` endpoint was a `[]` stub** → wired to `prisma.supplier.findMany`; also loosened part-modal `s.isActive` filter (schema has no such column)
- [x] Add Employee — **`CreateEmployeeDto` was rejecting `status` field** sent by frontend → added `EmployeeStatus` field to DTO

### Profile update (BUG-063)
- [x] Backend: `GET /users/me` + `PUT /users/me` routes (password/role whitelisted out so users can't self-escalate or bypass change-password)
- [x] Frontend: Profile form was a `setTimeout` fake-success stub → now PUTs firstName/lastName/email/phone; refreshes local currentUser signal so header rerenders
- [x] Verified: phone edit persists in DB (`+216 98 123 456` → `+216 20 555 777`)

### AI page / Preferences / Photos (BUG-071, 064, 067)
- [ ] BUG-071: AI module has backend endpoints but no `/ai` frontend route — needs a page component. Feature gap, logged 🔴.
- [ ] BUG-064: Profile Preferences save is still a `setTimeout` stub — needs a `UserPreference` Prisma model + endpoint. Logged 🔴.
- [ ] BUG-067: `PhotoUploadComponent` exists in `src/app/shared/` but is never imported; `PhotoService` is `URL.createObjectURL` + signal array (no HTTP). Backend has no `Photo` model. Full feature work. Logged 🔴.

### Approvals (BUG-065)
- [x] Approve + Reject buttons verified end-to-end (created approval via API — no UI create button)
- [ ] Type enum mismatch (frontend 8 types vs backend 4) + "Approved by on" missing name/date — BUG-089/090, open

### Stock Adjustment modal (BUG-066)
- [x] Modal opens, adjustment type/reason/qty flow works, stock persists (8 → 13)
- [x] **Audit trail fixed (BUG-091):** new `POST /inventory/:id/adjust` endpoint writes `stockMovement` rows; frontend `PartService.adjustStock` switched from bare PUT to the new endpoint. Verified 2 audit rows after UI adjustments.

### Approval type alignment (BUG-089/090)
- [x] Frontend `ApprovalType` enum cut from 8 legacy values to the 4 backend actually supports (MAINTENANCE, INVOICE, PURCHASE_ORDER, DISCOUNT)
- [x] Service `mapType` + model `APPROVAL_TYPE_LABELS` + stats `byType` shape updated
- [x] i18n keys replaced in en/fr/ar.json. Type dropdown + row badges now render real labels ("Purchase Order", "Discount") instead of "Other"

### Invoice Print (BUG-069)
- [x] Detail page `onPrint()` calls `window.print()` — verified real native print dialog
- [x] List-card Print was a no-op (`$event.stopPropagation()` only) → now navigates to `/invoices/:id?autoPrint=1`; detail `ngOnInit` consumes the query param and auto-triggers `window.print()` ~300ms after the invoice renders
- [x] PDF is served via the browser's "Save as PDF" print destination (onDownloadPDF just calls onPrint) — not a dedicated PDF endpoint but acceptable for MVP

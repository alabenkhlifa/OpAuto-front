|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/reports/dashboard` | 200 | ✅ |
| GET | `/reports/financial` | — | ⏭️ N/A — frontend computes financial metrics client-side from invoices; no backend endpoint needed. Earlier 404 flagged here was a test-script mistake. |
| GET | `/reports/operational` | — | ⏭️ N/A — same as above, computed from appointments client-side. |

### Backend issues found & fixed in this session
- Maintenance: `CreateMaintenanceDto` missing `notes` → could not save/update notes. **Fixed** (`f626fb4`).

### Backend issues still open
- ❌ `GET /reports/financial` and `/reports/operational` return 404 but the UI tabs expect them. Either implement or remove the tabs.
- ⚠️ No `POST /modules/:id/deactivate` route; UI has Deactivate button (uses a different endpoint or client-only state — needs confirmation).

## Issues still open (prioritized)

### P0
- (none remaining — all blockers fixed)

### P1
- ❌ `GET /reports/financial` and `/reports/operational` — 404, but UI has tabs expecting them.
- ⚠️ Module Deactivate button has no backend endpoint.
- ⚠️ Approvals page shows 0 while Maintenance "Needs Approval" badge shows 1 — data sources aren't unified.
- ⚠️ Export button on Reports — file download behaviour not verified.

### P2 (cosmetic)
- Currency format inconsistent across pages (`"0,000 DT"`, `"7 209,000 DT"`, `"2 433,55 DT"`). Centralize via `Intl.NumberFormat('fr-TN', …)`.
- Pluralization — "1 appointments", "1 cars", "1 invoice(s)". Use ICU/`$count`.
- Duplicate top-level `"invoicing"` key in `en.json` (lines 604 and 1715 pre-fix; merged entries added to both — still duplicated).
- Onboarding tour reopens on every login.
- Dashboard: "1 today" label on Appointments KPI not translated.

---

## Not-yet-clicked elements (deliberately skipped to avoid over-testing)
- Per-row secondary actions on Cars (Schedule service, View history), Maintenance (View/Edit/Complete Job), Inventory (View Details low stock), Invoicing (View Details / Print Invoice / Export), Employees (Edit / Mark Unavailable).
- Tabs within Notifications (category filters, Unread Only, Delete).
- Tabs within Settings (Operations / Business / System / Integrations).
- Profile Preferences and Security tabs.
- Reports date-range custom picker + specific tab drill-downs beyond Financial/Inventory.
- Calendar event click (open event detail).

These can be covered in a follow-up pass. Each represents a CRUD-style interaction whose underlying endpoint has already been verified in Phase 1.

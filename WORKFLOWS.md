```

## üîß Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process

1. **Start Development Session**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main       # Get latest changes
   npm install               # Install dependencies if needed
   ng serve                  # Start development server
   ```

2. **Code Development**
   - Follow Angular best practices (see TECHNICAL.md)
   - Use global design system (see UI-SYSTEM.md)
   - Write tests before implementing sensitive functions
   - Test UI changes with Playwright when specified

3. **Pre-Commit Checklist**
   ```bash
   npm run lint              # Check code quality
   npm run test              # Run unit tests
   npm run build             # Verify build succeeds
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feature: implement new functionality"
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

### Feature Development Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Review feature requirements in FEATURES.md
   - Check design system requirements in UI-SYSTEM.md
   - Plan implementation approach using TECHNICAL.md guidelines

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/feature-name`
   - Implement using established patterns
   - Follow UI verification process for any UI changes
   - Write comprehensive tests

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Unit tests: `npm run test`
   - E2E tests: `npm run e2e`
   - Manual testing across devices
   - Playwright validation when specified with "use PL"

4. **Integration Phase**
   - Code review and approval
   - Merge to main branch
   - Deploy to staging/production

## üß™ Testing Workflows

### Unit Testing Workflow

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   ```bash
   # 1. Write failing test
   ng test --watch           # Run tests in watch mode
   
   # 2. Implement minimal code to pass
   # 3. Refactor while keeping tests green
   # 4. Repeat cycle
   ```

2. **Coverage Requirements**
   ```bash
   ng test --code-coverage   # Generate coverage report
   # Target: 80%+ coverage for core functions
   # Check coverage/index.html for detailed report
   ```

### End-to-End Testing Workflow

1. **E2E Test Development**
   ```bash
   ng e2e                    # Run existing e2e tests
   ng generate cypress-schematic  # Add Cypress support
   ```

2. **Playwright Testing (when "use PL" specified)**
   ```bash
   # Playwright tests for UI validation
   # - Direct navigation to target pages
   # - Element visibility checks
   # - Screenshot verification
   # - Text contrast validation
   ```

## üé® UI Development Workflow

### Design System Compliance

1. **Pre-Implementation Checklist**
   - Read DESIGN_SYSTEM_CHECKLIST.md
   - Review UI-SYSTEM.md for component patterns
   - Check existing implementations for consistency

2. **Implementation Process**
   ```bash
   # 1. Use global design system classes only
   # 2. Follow established patterns exactly
   # 3. Test in dark mode (permanent theme)
   # 4. Verify accessibility compliance
   ```

3. **UI Verification Process (MANDATORY)**
   ```bash
   # When "use PL" specified:
   # 1. Take dark mode screenshots
   # 2. Check text contrast programmatically
   # 3. Validate visual consistency
   # 4. Document results before claiming "fixed"
   ```

### Component Development Pattern

1. **Create Component**
   ```bash
   ng generate component feature/component-name --standalone
   ```

2. **Apply Design System**
   - Use global button classes: `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, etc.
   - Use global badge system: `badge badge-active`, etc.
   - Use global card system: `glass-card`
   - Follow navigation toggle patterns

3. **Test Responsiveness**
   - Desktop: 1024px+
   - Tablet: 768px-1023px
   - Mobile: 375px minimum (iPhone SE 2020)

## üåê Translation Workflow

### Adding New Translations

1. **Update Translation Files**
   ```bash
   # Edit translation files:
   # - src/assets/i18n/en.json
   # - src/assets/i18n/fr.json
   # - src/assets/i18n/ar.json
   ```

2. **Translation Key Convention**
   ```json
   {
     "feature.component.element": "Translation text",
     "common.save": "Save",
     "auth.login.title": "Sign In"
   }
   ```

3. **Test Translations**
   ```bash
   # Test all three languages
   # Verify RTL layout for Arabic
   # Check date/time formatting
   # Validate currency formatting (TND)
   ```

### Playwright Translation Testing
```bash
# When "use PL" specified for translation testing:
# 1. Set localStorage language to Arabic
# 2. Navigate directly to target pages
# 3. Verify text rendering and RTL layout
# 4. Check all UI elements are properly translated
```

## üöÄ Deployment Workflow

### Build Process

1. **Development Build**
   ```bash
   ng build                  # Development build
   ng serve --prod           # Test production mode locally
   ```

2. **Production Build**
   ```bash
   ng build --configuration=production  # Production optimized build
   ng build --localize      # Build with all locales
   ```

3. **Build Verification**
   ```bash
   # Check build artifacts in dist/ folder
   # Verify bundle sizes are optimized
   # Test in production mode
   ```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The translation testing framework is built on the following architectural principles:

#### 1. **Modular Test Utilities**
```
tests/translation/utils/
├── translation-utils.ts          # Core translation testing utilities
└── screen-specific-utils.ts      # Specialized utilities for different screen types
```

#### 2. **Screen-Specific Test Suites**
```
tests/translation/
├── auth.spec.ts                  # Authentication & Access screens
├── dashboard.spec.ts             # Dashboard & Overview
├── cars.spec.ts                  # Vehicle Management
├── maintenance.spec.ts           # Maintenance & Service
├── [planned].spec.ts             # Additional screens (planned)
└── run-translation-audit.ts      # Comprehensive audit runner
```

#### 3. **Automated Reporting System**
- **JSON Reports**: Machine-readable detailed results
- **HTML Reports**: Visual dashboard with metrics and recommendations  
- **Screenshots**: Visual documentation per screen/language
- **Audit Runner**: Automated test execution with comprehensive reporting

### Key Technical Features

#### ✅ **Language Switching Implementation**
Following CLAUDE.md guidelines:
```typescript
// Direct localStorage manipulation (no auth navigation)
await utils.switchLanguage('ar');
localStorage.setItem('language', 'ar');
await page.reload();
```

#### ✅ **Hardcoded Text Detection**
Automated detection of untranslated text:
```typescript
await utils.verifyNoHardcodedText();
// Checks for common English words in non-English contexts
// Validates form labels, buttons, status indicators
```

#### ✅ **Arabic Text Rendering Verification**
```typescript
await utils.verifyArabicTextRendering();
// Validates Arabic script characters render correctly
// Checks for replacement characters or display issues
```

#### ✅ **Comprehensive Form Testing**
```typescript
await utils.verifyFormTranslations();
// Tests input labels, placeholders, validation messages
// Verifies dropdown options and help text
```
